Patrace
=======

PATrace is software for capturing GLES calls of an application and replaying them on a different device, keeping the GPU workload the same. It's similar to the open source Apitrace project, but optimised for performance measurements.

Caveats
-------

PATrace cannot open trace files captured with the open source Apitrace.
